-Whoring is now determined by designation not by bed. Whorebeds not buildable anymore.
-Whoring designation works on prisoners.
-Added unhappy thoughts on whoring (diminishes with experience). Some backstories (defined in Defs/SpecialBackstories.xml) count as a lot of experience. Prisoners get different more severe mood hit.

-Added animal designation used to select beasts that are allowed to use breeding designated pawns.

-Added adoption (Claim Child operation). If you see any child laying around, you don't need to trouble yourself with warden persuation. You can designate child for this operation and it will be included in your faction right away.
This is doen as surgery operation and requires medicine (but doesn't fail).  I cannot get it work otherwise, chadcode just shits some unintelligible errors happening a dozen calls away from the mod code. Consider the med requirement an adoption census.
v1.6.3_rwg
Anonimous release
-Fixed broken body hediff to give the mood offsets as it should. 
(btw, if someone didn't understand that, it probably be broken mind, but the meaning was lost in translation by original author)
-Reworked pregnancy. 
It is now even more compatible with Children and Pregnacy mod. If the latter is acitve, its pregnancy system is used if possible. Otherwise, rjw simpler pregnancy is used. 
-RJW pregnancy works for any pair of humanlike pawns. There are settings determining the race of the resulting child.
-RJW pregnancy defines the child at the moment of conception. Loading saves should not reroll the newborn.
-Added menu toggle to deactivate human-animal pregnancy (why would anyone need that? It's boring.)
-Added animal equivalent of designate for comfort. Animals beat prisoners less often.
-Animals born from human mothers receive random training in varied skills up to half of their max training. 
-Animal babies use different relation than normal children, if the animal dies its human parent doesn't get as significant debuff as with human child. 
-Fixed (probably?) fathers disappearing from child relations due to garbage collection . At least inheritance information is now preserved for sure. Does not apply to CnP, but it wasn't probably affected much anyway (due to both parents typically staying in the game for longer than ordinary raider). 

v1.6.2_rwg
Anonimous release
-Added "submit" combat ability. Makes colonist lay down and stop resistance. Colonist is incapacitated for 1-2 hours.
If you rescue them, the effect disappears right away. (Being little sissies they are, they won't dismount themselves off strong arms of their savior unless you make them to.)
