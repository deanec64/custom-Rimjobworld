		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] is made as a sex machine, rather than a human. During [PAWN_possessive] growing period in the factory, [PAWN_pronoun] was taught plenty of social skills and sex skills, just to satisfy various sex demands.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] struts around the colony like a conqueror examining a newly annexed territory. You try to focus on your work but [PAWN_pronoun] won't let you.\n
"I heard what you said about me!" [PAWN_pronoun] accuses. You didn't say anything about [PAWN_objective]. [PAWN_pronoun] knows that. "Wanna fight?" [PAWN_pronoun] challenges. You already know what [PAWN_pronoun] means: a few minutes of play wrestling and then you take [PAWN_objective], or, if you hesitate, [PAWN_pronoun] takes you.\n
Though [PAWN_nameDef] can be hard to get along with you've come to appreciate how [PAWN_pronoun]'s more practical than the others.\n
You explain to [PAWN_objective], "See these things here? They need to be over there" and "Those people are trying to kill us, so let's kill them first." [PAWN_pronoun] listens, and does what is necessary.</description>

		<description>Hold the covering plate back and place the actuator in slot C. Line the rod up. No, that won't do, it needs to be perfect. Now pop the JC-444 chip in place.\n
Solder the orange wire to pin #16 and the striped wire to pin #5.\n
Suddenly, there [PAWN_pronoun] is. You aren't surprised to see [PAWN_nameDef], you just didn't hear [PAWN_objective] approach. By now you're used to it.\n
You continue your work in silence as [PAWN_pronoun] hovers over you, her large eyes fixated on the rapid, rythmic, deliberate motions of your hands.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] has a pair of charming eyes, and [PAWN_possessive] voice is soft and sweet. Due to [PAWN_possessive] previous nurse job, [PAWN_pronoun] tends people quite well.\n
[PAWN_pronoun]'s crouched in the corner, hands over [PAWN_possessive] ears and tears in [PAWN_possessive] eyes. You don't understand, then you notice it: the distant sound of the pained squeals of pigs being slaughtered.</description>

		<description>Maybe [PAWN_nameDef] suffered some terrible things, [PAWN_pronoun] looks rather emaciated, and no one wants to speak with [PAWN_objective].\n
[PAWN_pronoun] only behaves a bit vivaciously while staring at some rod-like stuffs.</description>
